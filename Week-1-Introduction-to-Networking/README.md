# Week 1 – Introduction to Networking

### 🧠 Topics Covered
- Overview of computer networks  
- Importance of networking in communication  
- Types of networks: LAN, MAN, WAN  
- Network topologies (Star, Bus, Ring, Mesh, Hybrid)  
- Communication models: Client-Server and Peer-to-Peer  
- **5-4-3 Rule** for Ethernet repeater networks

### 🔎 5-4-3 Rule (Ethernet)
The **5-4-3 rule** is an old Ethernet design rule for repeater-based networks (like early 10Base-5 / 10Base-2).  
It states that between any two end stations there can be **at most 5 segments** connected by **4 repeaters**, and **only 3 of those segments may be populated (have hosts attached)**.  
This rule helps limit collision domains and ensure signal timing stays within specifications for early Ethernet topologies.

**Why it matters:**  
- It’s historical but useful to understand Ethernet timing and collision domains.  
- Helps you understand why modern switched networks replaced hubs/repeaters for better performance.

### 🧰 Practical Lessons
- Identified different network setups  
- Discussed real-life applications of each topology  
- Compared network types and use cases  

### 🧩 Key Takeaway
Networking forms the foundation of all modern communication systems.  
Every connection — from a phone call to the internet relies on networking principles.
