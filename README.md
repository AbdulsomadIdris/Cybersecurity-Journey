# Networking and Cybersecurity Journey

This repository documents my learning journey in Networking, as part of my training at Femtech, Ilorin.  
I’ll later expand it to cover my Cybersecurity journey once I begin that phase.

Each week includes class notes, practicals, and summaries of key topics covered.

---

## Week 1 – Introduction to Networking
- Learned the basics of computer networking and its importance  
- Understood types of networks (LAN, MAN, WAN)  
- Covered network topologies and communication models  

---

## Week 2 – Network Cables and Connectors
- Studied different cable types: Coaxial, Twisted Pair, and Fiber Optic  
- Learned the difference between STP and UTP cables  
- Understood RJ45 connectors and how to crimp cables properly  

---

## Week 3 – Network Components
- Covered hardware components: Router, Switch, Hub, Modem, NIC, Access Point  
- Studied software components: Network Operating Systems, Protocols  
- Practiced identifying devices and their functions  

---

## Week 4 – IP Addressing and Subnetting
- Learned IPv4 and IPv6 structures  
- Understood public, private, static, and dynamic IPs  
- Practiced subnetting calculations using:
  - Network IP Address  
  - Broadcast IP Address  
  - First and Last Host  
  - Number of Segments  
  - Number of Devices  

---

## Week 5 – OSI & TCP/IP Models
- Studied all 7 layers of the OSI model and their functions  
- Understood the 4-layer TCP/IP model and its relationship with OSI  
- Learned common ports and services (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, FTP, SSH, etc.)

---

## Week 6 – System/Router Configuration
- Practiced basic router configuration  
- Set up LAN connections and tested with a cable tester  
- Configured wireless access point (AP)  

---

## Week 7 – Cisco Packet Tracer Practical
- Learned to simulate networks using Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Created topologies and assigned IP addresses  
- Tested connectivity using ping and verified device communication  

---

## Future Phase – Cybersecurity
Once I complete the networking module, this repository will expand into Cybersecurity, where I’ll document:
- Fundamental security concepts  
- Hands-on labs and tools (Wireshark, Nmap, and so on.)  
- Projects and certifications achieved
