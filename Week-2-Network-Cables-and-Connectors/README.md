# Week 2 – Network Cables and Connectors

### 🧠 Topics Covered
- **Types of Networking Cables**
  - **Coaxial Cable:** Old Ethernet cable type using electric pulses for data transfer. Two main types:
    - *Thicknet (10Base5)* – up to 500m (professionally 485m)
    - *Thinnet (10Base2)* – up to 200m (professionally 185m)
  - **Twisted-Pair Cable (LAN/Ethernet Cable):**
    - Most common cable type in use today
    - Uses electric pulses to transmit data
    - Max length: 100m (professionally 85m)
    - Connector: **RJ45**
    - Two categories:
      - *UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)*
      - *STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)*
  - **Fiber Optic Cable:**
    - Uses **light pulses** instead of electricity
    - Immune to interference (EMI)
    - Made of glass or plastic fibers
    - Two main types:
      - *Single Mode* – long-distance, high-speed
      - *Multimode* – short-distance, multi-path

### 🧩 Termination & Color Codes

**Termination:**  
Process of connecting a cable to its connector (RJ45) using a **crimping tool**.

**Color Standards:**  
There are two standards for cable wiring:
- **568A**
- **568B**

| 568A         | 568B         |
|------        |------        |
| White/Green  | White/Orange |
| Green        | Orange       |
| White/Orange | White/Green  |
| Blue         | Blue         |
| White/Blue   | White/Blue   |
| Orange       | Green        |
| White/Brown  | White/Brown  |
| Brown        | Brown        |

### 🔌 Types of Ethernet Cables
1. **Straight-Through Cable** – connects *different* devices (e.g., PC → Switch)  
2. **Crossover Cable** – connects *similar* devices (e.g., PC → PC, Switch → Switch)

---

### 🧰 Practical Work
- Created LAN cables using **crimping tools**
- Used **RJ45 connectors** and verified with **cable tester**
- Learned to identify cable faults (open, short, crossover)

---

### 🧩 Key Takeaway
Network cables are the backbone of physical connectivity.  
Proper cable selection, termination, and testing ensure reliable data transfer and network performance.
