# Week 3 – Network Components

### 🧠 Topics Covered
A **network component** is any hardware or software element that enables devices to communicate and share data across a network.  
These components work together to ensure smooth, secure, and efficient data transmission.

## 🧩 Hardware Components

### 1. **Network Interface Card (NIC)**
- Enables a computer or device to connect to a network (wired or wireless).
- Converts data into signals for transmission.
- Each NIC has a **unique MAC address**.
- Two types:
  - *Wired NIC* – uses cables (Ethernet)
  - *Wireless NIC* – uses Wi-Fi or Bluetooth

---

### 2. **Switch**
- Connects multiple devices within a LAN and forwards data to the correct destination using **MAC addresses**.
- Works at the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** of the OSI model.
- Improves network efficiency compared to a hub.

---

### 3. **Router**
- Directs data packets between networks (e.g., LAN to WAN).
- Uses **IP addresses** and **routing protocols** to find the best path.
- Works at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)** of the OSI model.
- Also provides DHCP, NAT, and firewall features in modern routers.

---

### 4. **Modem**
- Converts digital signals from a computer to analog signals for transmission (and vice versa).  
- The term stands for **Modulator/Demodulator**.  
- Connects local networks to the **Internet Service Provider (ISP)**.

---

### 5. **Hub**
- Basic network device that broadcasts data to all connected devices.
- Operates at the **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**.
- Less efficient than switches (causes collisions).
- Rarely used in modern networks.

---

### 6. **Wireless Access Point (WAP)**
- Creates a **wireless network (WLAN)** that allows devices to connect via Wi-Fi.
- Connects to a wired router or switch.
- Extends network coverage.

---

### 7. **Server**
- A computer that provides shared resources (files, data, printers, or apps) to other devices (clients).

---

### 8. **Client**
- Any device (PC, phone, tablet) that accesses and uses resources from a server.

---

### 9. **Repeater**
- Regenerates and amplifies weak signals to extend the network range.
- Operates at the **Physical Layer**.

---

### 10. **Media (Transmission Medium)**
- The physical path through which data travels.
- Types:
  - *Wired Media* – Coaxial, Twisted Pair, Fiber Optic
  - *Wireless Media* – Radio, Infrared, Microwave, Satellite

---

## 🧩 Software Components

### 1. **Network Operating System (NOS)**
- Manages network resources and provides services such as:
  - File sharing  
  - Security & authentication  
  - Device management  
- Examples: **Windows Server, Linux, macOS Server**

### 2. **Protocols**
- Set of rules that define how data is transmitted and received.
- Examples:
  - **TCP/IP** – Core internet communication protocol
  - **HTTP/HTTPS** – Web communication
  - **FTP** – File transfer
  - **SMTP** – Email
  - **DNS** – Domain name resolution

---

## 🧰 Practical Work
- Identified real-life network devices and components  
- Connected systems using switches, routers, and access points  
- Observed how signals flow through different devices  
- Discussed network efficiency and data flow paths

## 🧩 Key Takeaway
Network components — both hardware and software — form the foundation of any computer network.  
Understanding how they interact helps you design, configure, and troubleshoot networks effectively.
